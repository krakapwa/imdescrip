""" A simple progress bar to reduce this package's dependencies. """

import sys

class Progress ():
    """ A very simple progress bar e.g. 'Title : [========            ] 80/200'.

    This class implements a fairly rudimentary progress bar, mostly to reduce
    the dependencies on external libraries which do a superset of what is
    required.

    The way this class is typically used is

        #Set up code
        ...
        progbar = Progress(max_val, ...)

        # Do something
        for i, it in enumerate(iterable)
            ...
            progbar.update(i)

        # Done and clean up
        progbar.finished()

    Arguments:
        max_val: int, the maximum value of iterations/items to iterate.
        cwidth: int, the with of the progress bar in characters (the number of 
            '=' characters).
        title: str, a title to show before the progress bar, this is optional.
        verbose: bool, whether to show any progress (True) or to be silent
            (False).

    """

        self.verbose = verbose

        if title is None:
            self.title = ''
        else:
            self.title = title + ' : ' 

        self.update(0)


    def update (self, val):
        """ Update the progress bar.

        This will draw and update the progress bar to reflect the current
        iterations/iterables done. That is current_value/max_value.

        Arguments:
            val: int, the current iteration/iterable object being operated on.
                This must be in the range [0, max_val] otherwise an error is
                raised.
