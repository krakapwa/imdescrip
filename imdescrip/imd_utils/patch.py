""" Functions for extracting, processing and displaying image patches.
    
    This file has a few useful functions for extracting and processing patches
    from images. For example, grid_patches() extracts from an overlapping dense
    grid in an image. pyramid_pooling() implements spatial pyramid pooling from
    [1]. There are also patch centring (DC component removal) and normalisation
    routines etc.

    Many of these functions are ports from the code developed for [1].
